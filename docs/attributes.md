FHL Attribute Primer
This article discusses the attributes of the FHL simulator and how they effect the sim engine.
In addition it will provide a comparison to what effect it has an actual NHL player.
This information has been acquired through many sources, messageboards, discussions and experience in making ratings and working within the simulator itself.
This is not done by the K, property of this article is unknown, and has been slighty advised

IT – Intensity.
Often discussed in two separate skills.
Goalies use intensity in a different form than skaters.
For Skaters, the attribute applies to hits & checking.
One could use toughness as an application as well.
Players like Darcy Tucker & Scott Stevens are intense NHL players that usually have high IT ratings in the sim.
The Sim gives high marks for intensity and often, skilled, less intense players can get penalized in overall rating due to less intensity.
All teams need some players with intensity, but too many is just as bad as too few…..Goalies are measured differently.
Intensity for a goalie is how in tune he is to a game.
Often, how alert he is to the slightest nuances of what is happening around him and his ability to anticipate ahead of time.
Think of goalies that have a knack for finding the puck through screens as an indicator of how IT can help a goalie.
Curtis Joseph is often a player who gets a very high IT rating in the simulator.
IT would be on the top 5 attributes for determining a quality goaltending and when the goalie skill stats are equal, this can be the difference maker.
Lastly, for skaters, IT is usually determined by the HITs statistic, whereas for goalies, it is a subjective stat.


SP – Speed is the first skill stat for goalies and skaters.
It is often called a subjective stat.
There is no NHL statistic in which it can be measured.
Although the simulator seems to favor the super highly rated Speed players who are 85 & above.
Anything above 70 is considered the NHL average or better skater.
Speed is one of the Big Three for goalie skill stats.
It pertains to how fast they can react for saves in both movement and glove/stick saves.


ST – Strength could be a misnomer because it is really measured by the overall size of a player.
And while size & strength are really two different things, it’s the best measurement of statistics available.
Since its nearly impossible to quantify strength without finding access to benchpress records of NHL players, it would have to be subjective and subject to all sort of misinterpretations of reality.
By using size, you have a good example of a solid stat.
Reading scouting reports you see the word "size" mentioned often, they are less concerned with strength and rightfully so.
A larger sized individual will wear down even a player of small stature and strength.
Size does matter in the NHL and it is reflected by the ST stat in the simulator.
The sim gives high marks for ST and it is a stats that will effect skater ratings extensively.
If you get a highly rated player without small size, you know he is a skill monster.
For goalies, ST can be a difference maker when the skill stats and IT are all equal.


EN – Endurance is and interesting stat.
It seems to be less influential to the OV rating than you might imagine.
Endurance is based on the average Ice Time per game a player receives in the NHL.
It is far more important for Defencemen than forwards.
Your #1 Defenceman must have high Endurance and it is suggested that at least two of your defencemen have endurance rating of 90 or above.
The 99 rating for endurance equals 30 minutes of ice time for defencemen and 25 minutes per game for forwards.
Every 15 seconds less than that lowers the rating one point.
It’s pretty easy to protect players with low endurance and is really only a factor to your key defenceman and top special teams players.


DU – Durability is a stat that hardly effects overall in any form.
Durability is more of an odds of injury than any other description I can think of.
Low DU is possible to go though an entire season uninjured as well as 99DU player getting injured.
With DU there is no sure thing, only that your odds of injury increase as DU decreases.
The one fact about DU is that a player is likely heal quicker the higher his durability & endurance.
DU is usually acquired by prorating the player’s number of games played divided by 82 and applying a similar decrease to the DU number from 99.
Leagues & ratings that use a player’s historical durability rather than based on just last year are far more accurate ratings.


DI – Discipline is a player’s likelihood to end up in the box plain & simple.
DI effects the OV rating in a minimal amount.
The one thing that has always plagued me about DI – does it effect a player’s penchant for being out of position.
Oddly enough players who historically make mistakes – defencemen who pinch at bad times, etc seemed to be saddled with lower DI than ones who possess uncanny hockey sense.
If you were to try and quantify hockey sense in the simulator, it seems logical that DI would be part of the equation.
Most rating use the PIM as a guide for arriving at a players DI giving credence for using it this more as a guideline for penalties, than mistakes.


SK – Skating works hand & hand with Speed in that it is a subjective skill statistic.
Skating refers to a player’s agility.
The ability to turn quickly, deke and make other moves in tight places.
It takes quite a few points in SK to effect the overall statistic in a skater, but for a goalie, its paramount.
Moving side to side and the agility to go down, get up, etc while making saves.
Skating is one of the top 3 skill stats for goalies.


PA – Passing Accuracy is most important in evaluation to the centers.
It stands to reason that players with high PA are gonna rack up assists.
Defencemen tend to be very effective when high PA is in concert with high DEF.
All your power play defencemen should possess good to high PA numbers.
PA is devised from the amount of assists produced by the player in the NHL with a different scale for defencemen & forwards.


PC – Puck Control affects OV rating across the board as much as single attribute in my estimation.
PC is huge in wingers, who need the ability to effectively move in traffic.
For defencmen you can drop all other skill stats to your hearts content, but if there is a high PC rating, the OV will only drop so far.
For goalies, this is a huge statistic.
PC refers to the ability to control rebounds, right there is all you need to know about how important it is to goalies – the last of the big 3 skill stats for goalies.
PC is a subjective attribute.


DEF – Defense awareness is most prevalent for defencemen.
It effects their ratings tremendously.
DEF is useful for forwards you use on the PK & Checking lines.
Centers with high DEF are especially effective, since their responsibility & positioning on the ice are of greater importance than a winger is.
DEF is basically a subjective stat, some leagues have tried to use +/- as a resource, but since that is more reflective of a team atmosphere, and I advise great caution when applying DEF to Plus/Minus.
The attribute has an average effect for forwards.


SC – Scoring… Surprise!
This has to do with ability to put the puck in the net!
;-) But you knew that already.
The stat is devised from the goals scored stat produced by the player in the NHL.
The scale for defencemen and forwards are different in regarding SC.
This is a huge stat for forwards as you can imagine and it takes good defencemen and turns them into great ones.


EX – Experience is based on the number of games a player has played with giving some extra weight to the playoff experience.
It has a limited effect on the OV rating.


LD – Leadership is basically subjective and player ratings seem to be in line with common knowledge about a player’s ability to provide leadership.
Most of the captains of NHL teams have very high leadership ratings.
The effect on the OV rating is limited.
But when the sim option of Experience & Leadership is turned on, these players provide a higher level of play, especially in key games and playoffs.
